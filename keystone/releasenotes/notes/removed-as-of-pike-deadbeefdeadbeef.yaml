    All key-value-store code, options, and documentation has been removed as of the Pike release.
    The removed code included ``keystone.common.kvs`` configuration options for the KVS code,
    unit tests, and the KVS token persistence driver ``keystone.token.persistence.backends.kvs``.
    All associated documentation has been removed.

    The ``admin_token_auth`` filter has been removed from all sample pipelines,
    specifically, the following section has been removed from ``keystone-paste.ini``::

      [filter:admin_token_auth]
      use = egg:keystone#admin_token_auth

    The functionality of the ``ADMIN_TOKEN`` remains, but has been incorporated
    into the main auth middleware (``keystone.middleware.auth.AuthContextMiddleware``).
