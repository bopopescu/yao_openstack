    Currently, if a project is deleted, it is not removed as a user's default
    project id. Now the default project id is set to none, however changes may
    not be visible until memcache end of life.

    The identity backend driver interface has changed. We've added a new
    ``unset_default_project_id(project_id)`` method to unset a users default
    project id matching the given project id. If you have a custom
    implementation for the identity driver, you will need to implement this
    new method.
